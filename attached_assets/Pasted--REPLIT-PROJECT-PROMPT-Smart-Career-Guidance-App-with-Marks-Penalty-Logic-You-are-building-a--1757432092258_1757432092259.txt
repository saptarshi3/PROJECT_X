ðŸš€ REPLIT PROJECT PROMPT: Smart Career Guidance App with Marks Penalty Logic

You are building a **full-stack Career Guidance Web App** that adapts recommendations based on **quiz answers + subject marks** with penalties for weak subjects.  

Stack:  
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TailwindCSS, React Router, React Flow  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express  
- **Design**: Glassmorphism cards  
- **Data**: Static JSON career clusters, weights, and penalties  

---

## ðŸ”¹ APP LOGIC

1. **Class Selection** â†’ Choose `10` or `11/12`.  
2. **Marks Entry**  
   - Class 10: Science, Math, English, Social Science, Regional/Other  
   - Class 11/12: Select Stream (Science/Commerce/Arts) â†’ Enter marks for relevant subjects  
3. **Adaptive Quiz**  
   - Class 10: Fun, kid-friendly questions (6 total)  
   - Class 11/12: Mature, streamlined quiz (6 total, see below)  
4. **Scoring**
   - **Marks Score**: Weighted avg (0â€“40%)  
   - **Penalty**: If marks <40 in core subjects, deduct score for careers tied to that subject  
   - **Quiz Score**: Cluster from quiz answers (0â€“40%)  
   - **Stream Weight**: Predefined score (20%)  
5. **Results**  
   - Top 3 Careers with explanation  
   - Glassmorphic UI with Score Breakdown  
   - Career Flowchart per stream

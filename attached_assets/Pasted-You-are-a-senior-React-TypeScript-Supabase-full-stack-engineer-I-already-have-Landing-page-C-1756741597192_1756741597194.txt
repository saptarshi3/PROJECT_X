You are a senior React + TypeScript + Supabase full-stack engineer.
I already have:

Landing page, Chat page (Gemini AI), Dashboard, Quiz, Authentication (Supabase)

Responsive layout, orange-grey theme, glassmorphism elements

Supabase setup (auth & data fetching)

Now implement PHASE 2 with this exact priority list:

🔥 PHASE 1: ULTRA-MODERN UI WITH 3D HERO

Make the Landing Page stunning with:

A 3D animated globe or rotating object using react-three-fiber + three.

Smooth parallax scroll animations.

Hero text floating over the 3D canvas.

Apply glassmorphism cards with blurred glass backgrounds and glowing borders.

Upgrade Navbar: smooth scroll, animated active states, sticky header.

Smooth light/dark theme toggle with framer-motion transitions.

Optimize for mobile-first responsiveness.

🔥 PHASE 2: CAREER EXPLORER (50+ CAREERS)

Create a Career Explorer Page with Supabase integration.

Supabase table: careers with fields id, title, description, skills, industry, resources.

Fetch careers dynamically and display in animated career cards.

Add filters (by industry/skills) and search bar.

Add a “Save Career” button to store careers in a user’s dashboard.

🔥 PHASE 3: PDF DOWNLOAD

Add a Download PDF button to Dashboard.

Use @react-pdf/renderer or jspdf to export a professionally styled PDF:

User’s name + quiz results

Saved careers with details and roadmaps

App branding and styling

🔥 PHASE 4: EXTRA FEATURES

Scholarship Finder (static cards first, API later)

Optional College Finder (Google Places or other API)

Code-splitting, lazy-loading for performance

Staggered animations for smooth page transitions

🔧 TECH + LIBRARIES

Vite + React + TS + TailwindCSS

Supabase for auth + data

framer-motion for animations

react-three-fiber + three for 3D elements

jspdf or @react-pdf/renderer for PDF

react-icons for icons

Keep clean, modular code; don’t rewrite working auth/chat/quiz—just integrate.

🎯 GOAL

Deliver a beautiful production-ready site with:

3D animated hero & premium UI

Career Explorer with dynamic data

PDF report generator

Extra pages (Scholarships, Colleges)

⚡ Implement in this priority order: UI/3D → Careers → PDF → Extras.

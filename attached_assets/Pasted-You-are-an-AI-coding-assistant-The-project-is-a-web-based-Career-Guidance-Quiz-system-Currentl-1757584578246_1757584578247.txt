You are an AI coding assistant. The project is a **web-based Career Guidance Quiz system**. Currently, Class 10 functionality is fully implemented and working. Do not modify Class 10.  

Your task is to **update Class 11–12 logic** to include:  

1. **Expanded career clusters and careers**:
   - Science: Engineer, Doctor, Pilot, Merchant Navy, Data Scientist, Research Scientist
   - Commerce: CA, Investment Banker, Entrepreneur, Business Manager, Economist
   - Arts: IAS, IPS, Lawyer, Teacher, Historian
   - Creative: Journalist, Designer, Filmmaker, Musician, Architect, Fashion Designer
   - Social: Psychologist, Counselor, NGO Worker, Social Worker
   - Vocational: Hotel Management, Chef, Tourism, Sports Coach

2. **Quiz questions for Class 11–12** (6 questions) mapped to all career clusters:
   - Q1: Subject Preference → career clusters
   - Q2: Daily Activities → career clusters
   - Q3: Post-12 Path → career clusters
   - Q4: Career Motivation → career clusters
   - Q5: Job Type Preference → career clusters
   - Q6: Work Environment → career clusters

3. **Marks logic & threshold checks**:
   - Keep existing Class 11–12 marks input system
   - Use thresholds for rare careers:
     - Pilot/Merchant Navy → Physics + Math ≥ 70
     - Doctor → Biology ≥ 70
     - CA/Finance → Accounts + Math ≥ 65
     - IAS/IPS → Pol. Science + History ≥ 65
     - Creative/Social/Vocational → interest-heavy, marks optional

4. **Interest scoring**:
   - Scan answers for keywords
   - Add points per cluster
   - Highest cluster = primary career direction

5. **Final score & confidence**:
   - FinalScore = (MarksScore × 0.4) + (InterestScore × 0.4) + (StreamWeight × 2)
   - Confidence: High ≥75, Moderate ≥50, Low <50
   - Detect mismatches: InterestScore >70 & Marks <50 → "Interest Driven, Needs Skill Boost"

6. **Career Recommendations**:
   - Show top 3–6 careers from the primary cluster
   - Include INR salary ranges

7. **College Recommendations**:
   - Map primary career cluster → relevant colleges
   - Use existing React cards/animation, only add extra streams

8. **Flowchart**:
   - Keep the **current Class 11–12 animated flowchart**
   - Add **new streams and rare careers** in the flowchart nodes
   - Maintain animation style, just expand nodes for: Vocational, Social, Creative, and rare careers like Pilot, IAS, IPS, Merchant Navy, Hotel Management, Journalism, Chef, Tourism

9. **Output**:
   - Update dashboard to show:
     - Primary Career Cluster + Confidence
     - Top careers with salary
     - Recommended colleges
     - Personalized advice
     - Flowchart animation showing full logic

10. **Constraints**:
    - Do not modify Class 10 system
    - Maintain current design/animations
    - Use modular JS/React functions for quiz, scoring, career mapping, and flowchart updates
    - Ensure new careers and streams are fully integrated into scoring, recommendations, and flowchart

Please generate **all code updates**, including:
- Updated question mapping
- Keyword-based scoring
- Threshold checks for rare careers
- Career recommendations
- College cards
- Updated animated flowchart for Class 11–12
- Modular React/JS implementation ready for Replit
